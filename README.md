Ahyangyi's OpenTTD NewGRF Library
=================================

![Unit tests](https://github.com/ahyangyi/agrf/actions/workflows/unit-tests.yml/badge.svg)

This library depends on [grf-py](https://github.com/citymania-org/grf-py), and implements additional high-level functionalities.

Main features:
* [gorender](https://github.com/mattkimber/gorender) and [cargopositor](https://github.com/mattkimber/cargopositor/) integration.
* Building (houses, stations, objects) library, modeling the OpenTTD features and abstractions such as symmetry modes on it.
* NewGRF parameter management, enabling parameter combination search.
* LayeredImage class to represent an image in the OpenTTD reality.
* "magic" classes such as MagicSwitch to simplify common transformations on NewGRF data structures.
